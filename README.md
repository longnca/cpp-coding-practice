## Basic exercises

1. Write a C++ program that displays mixed data types and arithmetic operations. 
2. Write a C++ program that swaps two numbers.
3. Write a C++ program to compute the total and average of four numbers.
4. Write a C++ program to calculate the sum of all even and odd numbers in an array.
5. Write a C++ program that swaps two variables without using a third variable.
6. Write a C++ program to add two binary numbers.
7. Write a C++ program that reads seven numbers and sorts them in descending order.
8. Write a C++ program that reads the integer n and prints its factorial.

## Basic Algorithm exercises

1. Write a C++ program to check if a given positive number is a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 7.
2. Write a C++ program to check the largest number among three given integers.
3.  Write a C++ program to check if two given non-negative integers have the same last digit.
4. Write a C++ program to check whether the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 appears in a given array of integers somewhere. (This problem involves array traversal and pattern matching, which are common in technical interviews.)
5. Write a C++ program to count the number of 5's next to each other in an array of integers. Count the situation where the second 5 is actually a 6. (This problem tests array traversal and condition checking.)
6. Write a C++ program to check if a triple is present in an array of integers or not. If a value appears three times in a row in an array it is called a triple. (This problem focuses on detecting patterns in arrays, which is a common task in data processing.)
7. Write a C++ program to check if two or more integers that are not negative have the same rightmost digit.
8.  Write a C++ program to find the larger of two given integers. However, if the two integers have the same remainder when divided by 7, then return the smaller integer. If the two integers are the same, return 0.
9. Write a C++ program to reverse a given array of integers of length 5. (Reversing arrays is a basic yet fundamental problem that tests understanding of array manipulation.)
10. Write a C++ program to count the even number of elements in a given array of integers.

## For-loop exercises

1. Write a program in C++ to check whether a number is prime or not.
2. Write a program in C++ to find the factorial of a number.
3. Write a program in C++ to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
4. Write a program in C++ to display the cube of the number up to an integer.
5. Write a program in C++ to display the sum of the series [9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 ...].
6. Write a program in C++ to display the first n terms of the Fibonacci series. (Fibonacci series is a classic problem that tests understanding of loops and recursion.)
7. Write a program in C++ to display the numbers in reverse order. (Reversing numbers tests understanding of loops and arithmetic manipulations.)
8. Write a program in C++ to check whether a number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. (This problem involves loops, condition checking, and prime number logic, which are common in coding challenges.)
9. Write a program in C++ to find the first and last digits of a number. (Extracting digits from a number is a basic yet essential skill in many numerical problems.)
10. Write a program in C++ to calculate the sum of the series 1.2+2.3+3.4+4.5+.......

## String exercises

1. Write a C++ program to reverse a given string.
2. Write a C++ program to capitalize the first letter of each word in a given string.
3. Write a C++ program to find the largest word in a given string.
4. Write a C++ program to sort characters (numbers and punctuation symbols are not included) in a string.
5. Write a C++ program to count all the vowels in a given string.
6. Write a C++ program to check if a given string is a palindrome or not.
7.  Write a C++ program to change the case (lower to upper and upper to lower cases) of each character in a given string.
8. Write a C++ program to remove all special characters from a given string.
9. Write a C++ program to find the longest sequence of consecutive ones in a given binary string.
10. Write a C++ program to check if a given string contains only uppercase or only lowercase letters.

## Array exercises

1. Write a C++ program to find the largest element of a given array of integers.
2. Write a C++ program to find the largest three elements in an array.
3. Write a C++ program to find the second largest element in an array of integers.
4. Write a C++ program to find the most frequent element in an array of integers.
5. Write a C++ program to separate even and odd numbers in an array of integers. Put all even numbers first, and then odd numbers.
6. Write a C++ program to separate 0s and 1s from a given array of values 0 and 1.
7. Write a C++ program to find a number that occurs an odd number of times in a given array of positive integers. In the array, all numbers occur an even number of times.
8. Write a C++ program to find the first repeating element in an array of integers.
9. Write a C++ program to find the number of pairs of integers in a given array of integers whose sum is equal to a specified number.
10. Write a C++ program to find the second lowest and highest numbers in a given array.
